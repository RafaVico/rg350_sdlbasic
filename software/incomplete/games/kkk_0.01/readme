1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow has destroyed Tails's computer and then Tails want to kill he

(Stupid story, eh?)

2. Why this was written
---------------------------------------------------------------

1) I written this because there are too few sonic fan games for Linux
(Not too few... there are only one! It's called Sonic Desert Run)
BUT: I founded Sonic Robo Blast 2. Very cool!

2) For fun

3) For learn better sdlBasic programming

3. How to launch
----------------------------------------------------------------

This game is cross-platform because is written in an interpetred language (sdlBasic)


Linux:
If you have the sdlBasic executable in your PATH, just open a terminal
and write ( in this directory ):

chmod +x ./kkk
./kkk

Windows:
Not tested. Put the sdlBasic exe into this directory and try from
a DOS box (in this directory):

sdlBasic kkk.sdlbas

I haven't tested this but i think that KKK probably starts.
Make modifications to the code if necessary.
If it starts, tell me at ( gsan92 at libero dot it )

Mac OS X:

Anyone want to test KKK on it?

4. How to play
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
You control Shadow and you must escape from Tails
If you collide with Tails... game over!
If you jump on Tails ... +1 of score (Bump)!
If you reach 15 bumps you won!

Controls:
Up Arrow = Jump
Left Arrow = Move Left
Right Arrow = Move Right
