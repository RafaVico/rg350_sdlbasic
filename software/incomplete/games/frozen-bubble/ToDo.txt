to do:
- 'Hurry' message
- screen wipe on stage transition
- bubbles flashing in intervalls
- the penguin controlling the cannon
- more accuraced inertia and gravity motion from falling balls
- fix bug from append balls
- keys option
- high score table
- weird bubble transparencies
- loading .fblevels folder
- .xvpics folder is not needed
- document thumbs.db is not needed (WdozNT crap...)

fixed:
- y distance between bubbles (28 instead of 32, like original Perl version)
(it provided weird situations like distance from pressing bar, and bubble queue limit, would have to be fixed)
